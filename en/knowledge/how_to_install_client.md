# How to install client (mod for Forge and Fabric)

This is an article that tutors how to install some type of client like Forge, Fabric, MCP (Version), Injection, etc.

Before you install a client, you must determine which type is this client or this mod based on, and which version is it run in. 

## Forge

Client: [LiquidBounce Legacy](https://vn.liquidbounce.net/download) (1.8.9), LiquidBounce 1.12.2 (deleted CCBlueX), [MinusBounce](https://minusbounce.lol/), [FDPClient](https://fdpinfo.github.io), NightX, [RavenB++](https://k-ov.github.io/download/), [RavenB+](https://github.com/Kopamed/Raven-bPLUS),..

Steps:
- Step 1: Make sure that you installed Forge (or ForgeOptifine in [TLauncher](https://llaun.ch/en) or [Legacy Launcher](https://llaun.ch/en)), installed the right version and it is run before.
- Step 2: Make sure that you downloaded the client from an official source and extracted if it is a zip, rar, or 7z file.
- Step 3: Open the `.minecraft` folder
	+ For TLauncher, Legacy Launcher, and SkLauncher, click on the Folder icon.
	+ For other launchers, press Windows and R, type `%appdata%` and enter. After doing this, click on `.minecraft` folder.
- Step 4: Click on the mods folder.
- Step 5: Copy and paste the file you downloaded
- Step 6: Start!

## Fabric

Client: [LiquidBounce NextGen](https://vn.liquidbounce.net/download), [ThunderHack Recode](https://github.com/Pan4ur/ThunderHack-Recode), ...

Steps: Install this as a Forge client.

Notes: You must install `Fabric Language Kotlin` if you are installing LiquidBounce NextGen.


## MCP (Version)

Client: Rise, Gothaj, Augustus b2.6, ... \
MCP is a type of client that contains a JAR file and JSON file

Steps:
- Step 1: Make sure that you downloaded the client from an official source and extracted if it is a zip or rar or 7z file.
- Step 2: Open the `.minecraft` folder.
	+ For TLauncher, Legacy Launcher, and SkLauncher, click on the Folder icon.
	+ For other launchers, press Windows and R, type `%appdata%` and enter. After doing this, click on `.minecraft` folder.
- Step 3: Open the `versions` folder.
- Step 4: Create a new folder, and set the name of the folder to the name of the JAR file.
- Step 5: Copy and paste the JAR file and JSON file into the created folder.
- Step 6: Restart the launcher, choose client, and start!

## Notes

- Don't install MCP Client as Forge (Many people found out that the JAR file is a Forge Client, so they install it into mods).
- Recommend for Forge: Install Optifine.
- Recommend for Fabric: Install Sodium, Sodium Extra, Lithium
- If Forge or Fabric throws errors, try to uninstall the mods that you installed.
