# How to install client (mod for Forge and Fabric)

This is a document that teaches you how to install any type of client like Forge, Fabric or MCP (Version).
Before you install a client, you must determine which type of client it is, so here are a few types of Minecraft clients below.

## Forge
Most common clients: [LiquidBounce Legacy](https://vn.liquidbounce.net/download) (1.8.9), LiquidBounce 1.12.2 (deleted by CCBlueX), [MinusBounce](https://minusbounce.lol/), [FDPClient](https://fdpinfo.github.io), NightX, [RavenB++](https://k-ov.github.io/download/), [RavenB+](https://github.com/Kopamed/Raven-bPLUS), etc.

Steps on how to install these clients:
- Step 1: Make sure that you have installed Forge beforehand. Forge can be found at [here](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/)
- Step 2: Make sure that you downloaded the client from an official source and extracted (if compressed)
- Step 3: Find your .minecraft directory
    + For TLauncher, Legacy Launcher, or SkLauncher you can click on the folder icon.
    + Of course you can also find the .minecraft directory by pressing Windows+R on your keyboard and typing in %appdata% in the popup window and pressing Enter afterwards. After doing this the Windows Explorer should open up and you should see a list of folders. You need to locate the .minecraft folder and open it.
- Step 4: Locate and open the mods folder.
- Step 5: Move the client’s jar file to this folder either by dragging and dropping it from window to window or by copy-pasting it.
- Step 6: Launch Forge in your preferred launcher and the client should notify you with either a custom main menu or some other type of sign.

## Fabric

Most common clients: [LiquidBounce NextGen](https://vn.liquidbounce.net/download), [ThunderHack Recode](https://github.com/Pan4ur/ThunderHack-Recode), Meteor, etc.

Steps on how to install these clients:
- Step 1: Make sure that you have installed Fabric and it’s API beforehand. Fabric can be found at [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) and the Fabric API is available at [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files/all?page=1&pageSize=20).
- Step 2: Make sure that you downloaded the client from an official source and extracted (if compressed)
- Step 3: Locate your .minecraft directory
    - For TLauncher, Legacy Launcher, or SkLauncher you can click on the folder icon.
    - Of course you can also find the .minecraft directory by pressing Windows+R on your keyboard and typing in %appdata% in the popup window and pressing Enter afterwards. After doing this the Windows Explorer should open up and you should see a list of folders. You need to locate the .minecraft folder and open it.
- Step 4: Locate and open the mods folder.
- Step 5: Move both the client’s jar file and the Fabric API jar to this folder either by dragging and dropping it from window to window or by copy-pasting it.
- Step 6: Launch Fabric in your preferred launcher and the client should notify you with either a custom main menu or some other type of sign.

Notes: You must install `Fabric Language Kotlin` if you are installing LiquidBounce NextGen.



## MCP (Version)

Most common clients: Lime, Sigma, Vestige and its forks, Eternal, etc…

Steps:
- Step 1: Make sure that you downloaded the client from an official source and extracted (if compressed).
- Step 2: Locate your .minecraft directory
    + For TLauncher, Legacy Launcher, or SkLauncher you can click on the folder icon.
    + Of course you can also find the .minecraft directory by pressing Windows+R on your keyboard and typing in %appdata% in the popup window and pressing Enter afterwards. After doing this the Windows Explorer should open up and you should see a list of folders. You need to locate the .minecraft folder and open it.
- Step 3: Find and open the versions folder.
- Step 4: Move the client
    + If the downloaded client is an archive and has a folder named the same as the files inside it then you can freely move the folder into your versions folder
    + If the downloaded client is only an archive with no folder inside, you have to create a new folder named the same as the files inside.
- Step 5: If your launcher is open, restart it and find the client as a version and start it!

## Notes
- Don't install an MCP Client as a Forge/Fabric mod as many people have done this to only find out that it doesn’t work and then go complain to the distributor of the client.
- Recommend mods for Forge: Optifine.
- Recommend mods for Fabric: Sodium, Lithium and Indium.
- If the client crashes either seek help at https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftclients/ or finding the client’s official discord server.
